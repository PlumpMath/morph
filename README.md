# Morph

Morph is a library of Haskell-style morphisms: monoids, functors, and monads.
These constructs are helpful for designing programs that are purely functional
and that encapsulate the boilerplate employed by many programming techniques.

## Features

* Implementation based on protocols and data types.
* Predefined monoids and functors; extended by Clojure collections.
* Monads: Identity, Maybe, Either, Reader, Writer, State.
* Monad Transformers: MaybeT, EitherT, ReaderT, WriterT, StateT.
* Support for curried functions.
* Library of generic functions for the above constructs.
* Sample monads in `src/main/resources`.
